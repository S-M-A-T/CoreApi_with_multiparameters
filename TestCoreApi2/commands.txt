The `Remove-Migration` command in Entity Framework Core does not have a `-Name` parameter. You can simply run `Remove-Migration` without any parameters to remove the last migration you created. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Step 1: Remove the Last Migration

1. In the Package Manager Console, execute the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-Migration
   ```

   This command will remove the last migration that was added.

### Step 2: Confirm Removal

You should see a message confirming that the migration has been removed. If you want to check the `Migrations` folder, you should see that the last migration file has been deleted.

### Step 3: Create a New Migration

Now you can create a new migration. Run:

```powershell
Add-Migration InitialCreate
```

or give it a different name if you prefer:

```powershell
Add-Migration NewMigrationName
```

### Step 4: Update the Database

Once the migration is created successfully, you can apply it to your database:

```powershell
Update-Database
```

### Additional Notes

- If you have already applied the migration to the database and you want to remove it, you need to roll back the migration first before removing it. You can do this with:

  ```powershell
  Update-Database -Migration <PreviousMigrationName>
  ```

- After rolling back, you can then run `Remove-Migration`.
